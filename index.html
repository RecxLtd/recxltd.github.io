				<h2 class="recxheading"><span>Cyber Security Services</span></h2>
				<p class="largetext">Recx offers a range of both bespoke and structured services, some of which are detailed below.
					We work closely with our customers to understand their needs and project requirements before creating a custom
					package of work. These can be half day briefings through to multi-month research engagements. Let us help you get
					the most out of your people and technology.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="prepend-1 span-20 append-1 last proservices">
				<div class="span-6 append-1">
					<h3>Vulnerability Research</h3>
					<p>Software and hardware often present an unknown risk within a organisation. Often products are mandated or can't
						be removed and as such understanding the potential exposure they present is key to structuring a defensive
						controls. Recx have strong experience inspecting products, reverse engineering, looking for vulnerabilities and
						where they're found looking to determine their potential.</p>
					<p>If you have products in your organisation which present an unknown risk, we can perform detailed analysis and
						act as liaison with the vendor to establish an accurate risk picture and an effective defensive stance.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="span-6 append-1">
					<h3>Product Evaluations</h3>
					<p>Selecting security products is a minefield. Every company claims that theirs is the best product and the
						perfect fit for your security and business needs. However our experience has shown that independent evaluation
						during the buying cycle can cut through marketing claims and ensure new security solutions don't contribute to
						your security problems by introducing unknown risks.</p>
					<p>Recx have extensive experience of reviewing security products as part of a due-diligence process. Verifying
						claims, mapping attack surfaces and intensively inspecting and instrumenting software products. We work within
						your evaluation window, providing you with detailed analysis. Our service is designed to provide you with the
						information with which to make the most informed choice about how best to protect your business assets.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="span-6 last">
					<h3>Security Assessments</h3>
					<p>Recx has considerable experience in performing application security assessments, at all stages of the
						development life cycle and using all major technologies and languages from C applications in embedded real time
						systems through to enterprise Java running in the cloud.</p>
					<p>We've moved away from doing traditional black-box security assessments, believing them to be inefficient,
						ineffective and not representative of actual attacker capability. In order for Recx to offer the most value to
						our clients, while ensuring efficient and accurate results delivery, we've found working closely with both the
						application source code and the developers gives the greatest customer return. We can work within both waterfall
						and agile development models and if desired submit any security issues directly into a bug tracking system.</p>

			<h2 class="recxheading">About Recx</h2>
			<p class="largetext">Over several years the concept of a small, agile, British security company had been conceived
				between the founders but
				it wasn't until late 2009 that Recx was finally born. Created to provide our combined experience in the fields of
				system and network defence,
				attack, exploitation and application security research to both public
				and private organisations.</p>
			<p class="largetext">Our blend of skills comes from real world experience of compromising and defending the
				technologies and networks developed
				and utilised by central Government, the military, law enforcement, financial services, telecommunications and
				software
				companies. Recx is perfectly placed to provide valuable capability, insight, intelligence and creativity to the
				challenges
				faced by twenty-first century computing security.</p>
